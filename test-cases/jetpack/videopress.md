- Add a VideoPress block.
- Add a video (e.g. from the WordPress Media Library).
- Select the block.
- Tap on the video.
- (Optionally) Use the player UI:
  - Play/pause button.
  - Volume control.
  - Progress control.
  - Settings menu.
  - Picture-in-Picture (Only enabled in tablets).
  - Fullscreen (automatically enabled when playing).

**Note when testing iOS:** The video will be played in fullscreen by default. To use the player UI you might need to close the fullscreen modal.

**Note when testing Android:** The video is played within a WebView, so expect that when tapping on the video a new screen is open. The player UI can be used within that screen.
