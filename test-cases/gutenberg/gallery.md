### Settings - Link to

**Precondition:** these steps should be tested via a self-hosted site

Gallery images should respect the `Link to` setting

**Steps:**

* Add a gallery block and tap "Add Media"
* Add some images from the media library
* Tap the block settings icon ⚙️ :gear:
* Tap `Link to` setting
* For each of the settings
  * <img src="../../test-cases/resources/gallery-settings-link-to.png" width="360">
  * Select the setting
  * Tap `...` menu -> "Preview"
  * Open in the browser
  * Tap an image

**Expected behavior:**

Setting | Expectation
-|-
Attachment Page | The browser should visit the attachment page for the image
Media File | The browser should visit the image location directly
None | The image should not be linked

**Note:** On .com sites, the behavior may be different:

In that case, the steps above will show different results (e.g. all images will be displayed in a carousel when tapped). Adjust the last step to long-press the image instead of tapping it.

**Expected behavior:**

The Media File option will show a "save link as" option. Attachment Page and None options will not show this option on long-press.
